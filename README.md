## Inspiration
We noticed the biggest cause for patient safety related problems was in the medication category. This motivated us to pursue a solution that could help patients to prevent this issue.
## What it does
Our app takes in user prescription information and allows the user to easily track their medications to prevent any medication related issues and spread more knowledge to the user about their prescriptions and any potential side effects that may appear. The users are never more than one click away from a call to their doctor!
## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Open FDA API, GitHub, and Netlify to consolidate practical, useful information that can be easily accessed through mobile or desktop applications.
## Challenges we ran into
Initially, we hadn't used GitHub before and struggled to manage the version control that GitHub has to offer. The complex built in JavaScript functions were also difficult to manage to produce information in the way we intended. We each had little experience using APIs and had trouble integrating the information that the API had to offer. We also had never created a PWA before and had to maneuver through the process of building one.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning JavaScript, APIs, and PWAs. Overall just learning a LOT of new languages and tools.
## What we learned
Flexbox, GitHub version control, API queries and interpretation, and PWA deployment procedures.
## What's next for Medication Tracker App
Give an alert for users when the prescription they're using has been recalled by the FDA in order to prevent any health hazards for the patient. We also wish to implement push notifications in order to remind user to take their prescriptions at designated times.
